            <h3>How poverty is linked with education ?</h3>
            <p>Poverty and education are a part of the vicious cycle.
                 If people are poor, they fail to give their children an education. 
                 Children are not even enrolled in primary education. Due to a lack of education, children are incapable of improving themselves and earning on their own.</p>
